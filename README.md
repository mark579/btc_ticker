# btc_ticker

Simple Bitcoin Ticker with a sense of Humor.

This uses the Luma Library to display to a MAX7219 display that would be connected to a Raspberry PI

## Config

Configuration is done in the config.yaml file.

Currently only one currency and vs_currency is supported at a time

## Usage

Once your MAX7219 is connected to your raspberry PI with an internet connection, run main.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

There are different modes for ways to display the information.

### Console

Displays display methods calls in the console. This is useful for headless environments which don't have a way to display the information other than the console.

```bash
MODE=CONSOLE python3 main.py
```

Example output:

```
‚ü© MODE=CONSOLE python3 main.py
{'ticker': {'crypto': 'bitcoin', 'vs_currency': 'usd', 'tell_jokes': True}}
text(tuple=(0, 0), message=$35,536, fill=white, font=proportional)
text(tuple=(0, 0), message=$35,536, fill=white, font=proportional)
text(tuple=(0, 0), message=$35,536, fill=white, font=proportional)
text(tuple=(0, 0), message=$35,536, fill=white, font=proportional)
text(tuple=(0, 0), message=$35,534, fill=white, font=proportional)
text(tuple=(0, 0), message=$35,534, fill=white, font=proportional)
text(tuple=(0, 0), message=$35,534, fill=white, font=proportional)
text(tuple=(0, 0), message=$35,535, fill=white, font=proportional)
text(tuple=(0, 0), message=$35,537, fill=white, font=proportional)
show_message(message=How come the stadium got hot after the game?.....Because all of the fans left., fill=white, font=proportional, scroll_delay=0.03)

```

### Pygame

Displays information in a Pygame Emulator.

This is useful for when you are in an environment other than a raspberry pi and you do not have a SPI/MAX7219 physical device.

```bash
MODE=PYGAME python3 main.py
```
